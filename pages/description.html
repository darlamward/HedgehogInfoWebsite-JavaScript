        Hedgehogs have an abundance of quills, which are spines made of many
        hallow hairs made stiff with keratin. The quills are not poisonous nor
        barbed and do not detach from their body easily. However, an immature
        hedgehog will go through a process called "quilling," meaning the baby
        hedgehog will shed its' baby quills, which will then be replaced with
        adult quills.

              Hedgehogs can roll into a ball for self-defense, causing their
              quills to point outwards. When a hedgehog rolls into a ball, their
              quills protect all of their vulnerable features that do not have
              any quills, such as their face, feet and belly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry less weight and are
              more likely to flee or attack an intruder by ramming an intruder
              with their quills; rolling into a ball is usually a last resort
              option.
            </p>

        Most hedgehogs are nocturnal. They sleep for most of the day in shaded
        areas or dens dug into the ground. All wild hedgehogs can hibernate, but
        it depends on the temperature, species and access to food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hedgehogs are vocal creatures and communicate through grunts,
        snuffles, squeaks and squeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hedgehogs sometimes perform a ritual called "anointing." They will lick
        and bite a new scent and then create a froth in their mouth with that
        scent, which they will then apply to their quills. It is unknown why a
        hedgehog anoints but many experts believe that hedgehogs use it as a way
        to camouflage in a new area.

        Hedgehogs have some natural immunity against some snake venom through
        the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinacine">erinacine</a> protien
        in their muscular system. Additionally, hedgehogs have a mutation that
        helps protect them from an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_venom#Neurotoxins"
          >α-neurotoxin</a
        >
        snake venom. Their mutation is in their
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"
          >nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</a
        >
        which prevents the α-neurotoxin snake venom from binding.
