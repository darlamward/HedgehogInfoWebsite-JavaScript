1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 
        Approximately 20 hours.
2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
        Youtube videos, lectures, notes, w3schools
3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)
        I asked Devin some questions as he had some of the same issues.
4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
        I messaged for a couple questions but ultimately with to a help session.
5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
        I didn't find it too difficult but I did run upon some issues that needed to be fine tuned. I could solve another problem like this one with minimal difficulty.
